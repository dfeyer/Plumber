Plumber -- FLOW3 and TYPO3 Profiling and Debugging Tools
========================================================
-- Measuring the flow of your application --

(c) Sebastian Kurfürst, Sandstorm Media UG (haftungsbeschränkt)

Installation
------------

```
cd <YourFlow3Root>/Packages/Application
git clone --recursive git://github.com/sandstorm/Plumber.git SandstormMedia.Plumber
git clone --recursive git://github.com/sandstorm/PhpProfiler.git SandstormMedia.PhpProfiler
cd ../../
./flow3 package:activate SandstormMedia.PhpProfiler
./flow3 package:activate SandstormMedia.Plumber
```

The system will automatically use XHProf if it is installed.

Usage
-----

Just use your website as normal. To browse profiling reports, go to `http://yourhost/SandstormMedia.Plumber/`

There, you can:

* **list** all profiling runs in an overview
* show a **graphical timeline** for a single profiling run
* **filter** the graphical timeline
* show the **xhprof** analyzer for a single profiling run
* **compare** two profiling runs with the timeline
* **tag** your profiling runs
* show **aggregated statistics** in the overview

Showing aggregated statistics
-----------------------------

If you have xhprof installed, then we can use the Xhprof run reports to show some detailed
statistics in the overview page. This is configured through some settings. Example:

```
SandstormMedia:
  Plumber:
    calculations:
      objectCreations:
        label: 'No. of Object Creations'
        type: regexSum
        regex: '#==>.*__construct#'
```

Inside `SandstormMedia:Plumber:calculations` follow some additional table columns which are shown in the overview page.

The `label` is the table column header. The `type` is the type of aggregation to perform. In the above example, we count constructor calls.

Type: regexSum
--------------

Example:
```
SandstormMedia:
  Plumber:
    calculations:
      objectCreations:
        label: 'No. of Object Creations'
        type: regexSum
        regex: '#==>(.*)::__construct#'
```


This one can be used to count function invocation counters. Examples:

```
#==>.*__construct#              Matches all constructor invocations
#==>.*TextNode::__construct#    Matches all constructor invocations of classes which end with TextNode
```

**Top 10**: When the RegEx contains a submatch, a popover is displayed with the top 10 invocations grouped by the regex. Examples:

```
#==>(.*)::__construct#              Matches all constructor invocations, displaying a Top 10 list of constructor invocations
#==>TYPO3\Fluid\(.*)::__construct#  Matches constructor invocations in Fluid, displaying a Top 10 list of constructor invocations inside the fluid package
```

Type: totalRuntime
------------------

Example:
```
SandstormMedia:
  Plumber:
    calculations:
      totalRuntime:
        label: 'Runtime (ms)'
        type: timerSum
        timerName: 'Profiling Run'
```

This one sums up the total runtime of a timer specified by `timerName`.

Type: maxMemory
---------------

Example:
```
SandstormMedia:
  Plumber:
    calculations:
      mem:
        label: 'Maximum Memory (kB)'
        type: maxMemory
```

Output the maximum memory consumption. Does not have any configuration options.

Type: [custom]
--------------

The aggregation types still need to be extended. They have to be implemented in the CalculationViewHelper.

Profiling TYPO3 v4 using Plumber
--------------------------------

You can also profile TYPO3 v4 using Plumber. For that, you need to install
https://github.com/sandstorm/typo3v4ext-plumber:

```cd typo3conf/ext; git clone https://github.com/sandstorm/typo3v4ext-plumber sandstormmedia_plumber```

Furthermore, you need a running FLOW3 installation which is used to show the
profiling data.

After installing the extension in TYPO3 v4, you need to specify the base path
to the FLOW3 installation.

Then, flush your caches and you should see a profiling run appear in Plumber
for every page request in TYPO3 v4.
